Semester Project

My name is Ricardo Almod√≥var & I have decided to start a project that moves people to show their comic book drawing skills and connect with others. Also for the readers and the comic book enthusiasts I decided to create this kind of center where you can come and find what you look for in the specific moment you are living. 
Say you want to read something adventurous, well then we can recommend different choices you might like. 
After all books, poems and comics are representation of our imagination and life here on Earth. Hope you enjoy this amazing project I am starting as of September 2, 2020, hoping to finalize at least part of it by the end of the year.
