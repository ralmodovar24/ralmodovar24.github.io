Ricardo Almodovar

Hello, as you already know, my name is Ricardo Almodovar, I am a Computer Science bachelor student at the University of Puerto Rico, Bayamon Campus. I am from Puerto Rico, I started this journey to become a frontend web developer to get immersed with what this world of technology can bring to us humans. My main mission is to develop applications that benefit every kind of person, so anyone can take advantage of it in some way. I have more than 4 years of experience, currently working as a Software Developer 2 at Wovenware, whom I have worked with for close a year. I welcome you to explore through my GitHub repos and if you want to see projects that are soon to be in the making, I'll leave the links below.
